## Libraries and Dependancies

This application leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/) - a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/user_guide/Introduction.html) - provides a high-level plotting API built on HoloViews and Bokeh that provides a general and consistent API for plotting data in all the abovementioned formats.

* [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) - the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

## Usage

This application works with SQL database in the following steps:

1. Organize dataframes based on data from SQL database to analyze a single asset in the ETF

2. Optimize data access with Advanced SQL queries

3. Analyze the ETF portfolio

4. Deploy the notebook as a web application - see the two-part video below:
